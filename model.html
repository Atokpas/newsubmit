		This website looked very Creative to me.So, I used the idea that was used to design this website to look great.I was inspired by the line below the navigation bar.Due to the help of this website I have designed my own website with line below the header making my webpage more attractive.<br><br>

		Similarly , the concept used in this websites looks stunning. The bacground image is ovelayed with the background color setting the opacity value. As , I am a great fan of a light black color that is transparent one. I got more than one reason to use this concept in my webpages. Hence, with thes two websites I came to an conclusive end of creating my interface design.<br><br>
